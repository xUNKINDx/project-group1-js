But not all goes to plan one is killed and the other three escapes with bags of gold hide out in the abandoned gold mine where they happen across another gang of three – who themselves were planning to hit the very same bank! As tensions rise, things go from bad to worse as they realise the bags of gold are filled with lead... they’ve been double crossed – but by who and how?</p>
